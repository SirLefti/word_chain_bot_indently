# Word Chain Bot for Indently
*The Indently Discord server's indigenous word chain bot!*

Join the [Indently Discord server](https://discord.gg/indently-1040343818274340935) to see this bot in action! 

### How to add the bot to my server?
The bot is not public in the sense that you cannot simply add it to your Discord server. If you want to add the bot to your server, 
please host it yourself.

### Where is the bot hosted?
The bot instance used in the Indently server is hosted on [bot-hosting.net](https://bot-hosting.net/?aff=1024746441798856717).
The free node they offer at zero cost works excellent compared to free nodes offered by other hosts. 
A premium node can also be purchased at a very cheap rate, which is what we use.
