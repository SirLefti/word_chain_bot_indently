## How to do migrations

* change the model classes in `model.py`
* create revision with the console
  * either as an autogenerated change: `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "<describe the change here>"`
  * or as am empty change: `alembic revision -m "<describe the change here>"`
* check the new file and change it if necessary (table and column renames are usually not detected by autogenerate)
* apply the change with `alembic update head` (or run the bot, which applies it as well in the setup hook)
